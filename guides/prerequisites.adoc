This guide walks you through the installation of tools required for working with
the SMART COSMOS DevKit for our main supported platforms, macOS and GNU/Linux.

NOTE: SMART COSMOS DevKit uses Docker container technology and therefore is
platform-independent. Although Docker is available on Windows platforms, we do
not develop or test on Windows.
The SMART COSMOS DevKit should run without problems on
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/[Docker for Windows].

[[macOS]]
== macOS

On macOS we highly recommend using http://brew.sh[`Homebrew`] to manage
software installations.

=== Install the Tools

==== http://brew.sh[brew]

 $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Now you need to enable https://caskroom.github.io/[*Homebrew Cask*] by running:

 $ brew tap caskroom/cask

This enables brew to use the `cask` subcommand, which
allows you to install binary applications.

==== https://git-scm.com/[git]

 $ brew install git

==== https://docker.com[docker]

 $ brew cask install docker

==== https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/[docker-machine]

[source, bash]
----
$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.9.0-rc2/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
----

=== Start the Docker Engine
If you installed docker the next step is to start
the `docker-engine`. To do this hit kbd:[cmd+space] to open
the Spotlight search, and enter
`docker`. Start the docker Application by hitting kbd:[Enter] after
Spotlight found the `docker` Application.
Now follow the instructions given by the docker start
dialog.

Docker will now automatically start when you log in. If you
prefer to start it manually you
can disable this behavior in the docker preferences. The preferences dialog can be reached
by clicking on the docker menu bar icon.

=== Check Docker Memory Settings
Please make sure that your docker VM has at least 5GB of Memory.

To adjust the
memory settings you need to click on the docker menu bar icon:

image::docker-icon-macOS.png[docker-icon]

Now click on `Preferences...`. You should see the following window:

image::docker-pref-macOS.png[docker preferences]

Here you should increase the Memory with the slider to at least 5GB.
Please click on the btn:[Apply & Restart] button to
apply the settings. Finally you
can close the window.

=== Install the DevKit

Please follow the link:install-devkit.adoc[DevKit install instructions].

[[linux]]
== GNU/Linux


=== Install the Tools

==== https://git-scm.com/[git]
Install git with the package manager, e.g., on Ubuntu with:

 $ apt-get install git

==== https://docker.com[docker]
Please follow the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/[official installation guide]
to install docker on a GNU/Linux system.

Make sure that you can use docker without sudo.

=== Install the DevKit

Please follow the link:install-devkit.adoc[DevKit install instructions].
