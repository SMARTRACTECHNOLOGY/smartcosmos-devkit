[[macOS]]
== macOS

On macOS we highly recommend to use http://brew.sh[`Homebrew`] to manage
software installations.

=== Install the Tools

==== http://brew.sh[Homebrew]

 $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Now you need to enable https://caskroom.github.io/[*Homebrew Cask*] by running:

 $ brew tap caskroom/cask

This enables brew to use the `cask` subcommand which
allows you to install binary Applications.

==== https://git-scm.com/[git]

 $ brew install git

==== https://docker.com[docker]

 $ brew cask install docker

=== Start the Docker Engine
If you installed docker the next step is to start
the `docker-engine`. To do this hit kbd:[cmd+space] to open
the Spotlight search, and enter
`docker`. Start the docker Application by hitting kbd:[Enter] after
Spotlight found the `docker` Application.
Now follow the instructions given by the docker start
dialog.

If you started docker successful it should now automatically start on each reboot. If you
prefer to start it manually you
can disable this behavior in the docker preferences. The preferences dialog can be reached
by clicking on the docker menu bar icon.

=== Check Docker Memory Settings
Please make sure that your docker VM has at least 5GB of Memory.

In the menu bar on the top right corner should now be a docker icon. To adjust the
memory settings you need to click on this icon:

image::docker-icon-macOS.png[docker-icon]

Now click on `Preferences...`. You should see the following window:

image::docker-pref-macOS.png[docker preferences]

Here you should increase the Memory with the slider to at least 5GB.
Please click on the btn:[Apply & Restart] button to
apply the settings. Finally you
can close the window.

=== Install the DevKit

Please follow link:install-devkit.adoc[the DevKit install instructions].
