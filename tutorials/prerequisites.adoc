On macOS we highly recommend to use http://brew.sh[`brew`] to manage
software installations.

=== Install The Tools

==== http://brew.sh[brew]
[source, bash]
----
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

==== https://git-scm.com/[git]
[source, bash]
----
brew install git
----

==== https://docker.com[docker]
[source, bash]
----
brew install docker
----

=== Check Docker RAM Settings
Please make sure that your docker VM has at least 8GB of RAM.

In the menu bar on the top right corner should now be a docker icon. To adjust the
memory settings you need to click on this icon:

image::docker-icon-macOS.png[docker-icon]

Now click on `Preferences...`. You should see the following window:

image::docker-pref-macOS.png[docker preferences]

Here you should increase the Memory with the slider to at least 8GB.
Please click on `Apply & Restart` to apply the settings. Finally you
can close the window.
