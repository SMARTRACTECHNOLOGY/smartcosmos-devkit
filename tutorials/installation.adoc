[[macOS]]
== macOS

On macOS we highly recommend to use http://brew.sh[`brew`] to manage
software installations.

=== Install the Tools

==== http://brew.sh[brew]

[source, bash]
----
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

==== https://git-scm.com/[git]

[source, bash]
----
brew install git
----

==== https://docker.com[docker]

[source, bash]
----
brew install docker
----

===== check docker RAM settings
Now we need to make sure that your docker vm has at least 8GB of RAM.

In the menu bar on the top right corner should now be a docker icon. To adjust the
memory settings you need to click on this icon:

image::docker-icon-macOS.png[docker-icon]

Now click on `Preferences...`. You should see the following window:

image::docker-pref-macOS.png[docker preferences]

Here you should increase the Memory with the slider to at least 8GB.
Please click on `Apply & Restart` to apply the settings. Finally you
can close the window.
