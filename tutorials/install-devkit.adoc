= Install The DevKit

Before you are able to start the DevKit make sure you have
link:prerequisites.adoc[installed all the prerequisites].

== Start The DevKit

To start the DevKit we provide a script which will help you to get the DevKit
up and running. You may also use `docker-compose` directly
to start all the services.

To keep things simple we will use the start script. All you need to do is to
execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
./start
----

== Next Steps

Now that you have a running DevKit you may follow
link:gettings-started.adoc[other getting started guides].
