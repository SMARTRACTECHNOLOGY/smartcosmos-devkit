= SMART COSMOS Objects v3 Basics Tutorial

This tutorial helps you get started with the Objects v3 DevKit. We'll describe the pieces of the DevKit and show
you how to use the APIs with working examples.

:numbered:
== Prerequisites

=== Install the DevKit

To get started with the Objects v3 DevKit refer to the link:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] guide.

=== Install Postman

We use link:https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman] to do much of the testing and development on our API. Postman is a GUI platform designed to make testing and development of your API easier.  For more information about Postman go to their
website at link:https://www.getpostman.com[https://www.getpostman.com].

In order to use our public collection link:https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/437937/smart-cosmos-objects-devkit-tutorial/2JvFAy[Postman SMART COSMOS Objects v3 DevKit Tutorial]
you will need to have an link:https://app.getpostman.com/signup?redirect=web[account on Postman] and link:https://www.getpostman.com/apps:[Postman apps] installed.

== Run the SMART COSMOS Objects v3 DevKit Postman Collection

The
link:https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/437937/smart-cosmos-objects-devkit-tutorial/2JvFAy[Postman SMART COSMOS Objects v3 DevKit Tutorial] is a public Postman collection that can be
used to exercise the DevKit API and familiarize yourself with the API.

. Start the DevKit, see link:install-devkit.adoc#start-the-devkit[Getting Started].
. Sign into link:https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman].
. Open the link:https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/437937/smart-cosmos-objects-devkit-tutorial/2JvFAy[Postman SMART COSMOS Objects v3 DevKit Tutorial].
. Select the *_Run in Postman_* button.

. This will download the collection and the corresponding environment template, _SMART COSMOS Objects DevKit Environment_ into the Postman app.

Now you can start running against your locally running DevKit.

=== Request Documentation

Documentation about each request is available in the Postman collection.  This documentation can be viewed by
selecting the small triangle next to the request title as shown in the following diagram.

image::postman-request-documentation.png[title="Request Documentation in Postman", alt="Request Documentation in Postman"]

=== Running All of the Requests Automatically

==== What Will Happen

You can begin testing by running all the requests against your running DevKit. Before
you can begin to use the SMART COSMOS Objects v3 system you will need to have a valid, active
tenant.  SMART COSMOS Objects is designed to be a multi-tenant system where each
account operates within its own security realm in order to keep one account’s data separate from another
account’s data. The security realm is established based on the tenant registration or creation.

Tenant registration is a public endpoint and does not require authentication. All other endpoints require a
valid authentication.  The _Create Tenant_ API is called first to create the tenant.  This request generates
random values for the administrator user name and for the tenant name and uses them to create a tenant.
These values are then saved into the environment and each subsequent request is executed in order.

. Open the collection by clicking the '>' next to the collection name. This will display some documentation about the test collection and a *Run* button will be displayed.
+
image::postman-run-all-begin.png[title="Open Page to Run All Requests Locally in Postman", alt="Open Page to Run All Requests Against a Local DevKit"]

. Click the *Run* button to begin executing the tests in order.
+
image::postman-run-all.png[title="Run All Requests Locally in Postman", alt="Run All Requests Against a Local DevKit"]

. Click the *Start Run* button in the Collection Runner.

==== View the Results

The results of the run will show automatically.  The first time you run the
tests many of them will fail and your results will look like the following;

image::postman-collection-run-failure.png[title="Postman Collection Run - Failure", alt="Postman Collection Run - Failure"]

This is usually because parts of the system are lazily initialized and require an initial attempt to start properly.
Retry the collection run by clicking the *Retry* button.

image::postman-collection-run-retry.png[title="Postman Collection Run - Retry", alt="Postman Collection Run - Retry"]

Subsequent attempts to run the test requests should result in success as shown below.

image::postman-collection-run-success.png[title="Postman Collection Run - Success", alt="Postman Collection Run - Success"]

Wether success or failure the results shown in the Postman Collection Runner can provide you with a
lot of detailed information about each request.  Including URL, HTTP verb, parameters and response details.

If you continue to encounter problems refer to link:troubleshooting.adoc:[Troubleshooting].

=== Running Requests Individually

When running the tests individually you must always make sure you have a current authentication token.  This token can
be acquired by running the _Acquire Authentication Token_ test.

Inspect the properties of the request you wish to tun including the URL, request type (e.g. POST),
the headers, body, pre-request script and tests.  Tests are executed on completion of the request
and are often used to set variables into the environment for other request to use.

==== What Will Happen

Before you can begin to use the SMART COSMOS Objects v3 system you will need to create a tenant.  SMART COSMOS Objects is designed to be
a multi-tenant system where each account operates within its own security realm in order to keep one account’s data separate from another
account’s data. The security realm is established based on the tenant registration or creation.

==== Create Tenant
Tenant registration is a public endpoint and does not require authentication. All other endpoints require a
valid authentication.  The _Create Tenant_ API is called first to create the tenant.  This request generates a
random user name for the administrator and the tenant name and uses them to create a tenant.  These values are then saved into
the environment.

Note in the above figure how new variables have been added to the environment by running the _Create Tenant_ request.

==== Acquire Authentication Token

== Ready to Go!

By now we hope you have a much deeper understanding of how the Objects v3 DevKit API works.  Be sure to check back frequently or when you have questions.  The Postman
collection is connected directly to our development team and is updated every time we add new features and capabilities.

For detailed information on our API see our link:https://api.smartcosmos.net/home/index.html[API Documentation] and the link:https://devkit.smartcosmos.net[DevKit website].
