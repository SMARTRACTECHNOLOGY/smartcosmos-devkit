= DevKit on an AWS EC2 Instance

This document guides you through the process of getting the SMART COSMOS DevKit
running on an AWS instance.
For that purpose you need to go through the following steps:

. write local aws client configuration file
. use `docker-machine` to start an instance with a docker engine

If you have done these steps you can deploy the DevKit as you would on
your local system. This is possible because the docker engine is a REST service.
The `docker` command line client will communicate with the remote engine.

[[awsConfig]]
== Write local AWS Configuration

NOTE: Credentials are required to create instances on AWS. While
it is not required we recommend setting your user credentials in a local
configuration file. Otherwise you would need to enter them on every
`docker-compose` command you execute, see the
https://docs.docker.com/machine/examples/aws/#/step-2-use-machine-to-create-the-instance[official docker documentation]
for further reference.

Create an AWS credentials file at
`$HOME/.aws/credentials`. It should contain the `key_id` and `access_key`
of the user you want to use to create the EC2 instance. Make sure that
user is allowed to create instances.
[source]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKID1234567890
aws_secret_access_key = MY-SECRET-KEY
----

== Start an AWS EC2 Instance with docker-machine

Make sure you have installed the
link:../prerequisites.adoc[prerequisites].

Run `docker-machine` with the `amazonec2` driver.

If you have configured your AWS credentials (as described in <<awsConfig>>) you can
now run:
[source, bash]
----
$ docker-machine create --driver amazonec2 devkit-on-aws
----

By default the instance is created in `us-east-1`.
You can also specify the *region* by using the flag `--amazonec2-region`:
[source, bash]
----
$ docker-machine create --driver amazonec2 --amazonec2-region eu-west-1 devkit-on-aws
----

There are more options for the `amazonec2` driver. Execute
`docker-machine --driver amazonec2 --help` to get all the available options,
or go to the https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/[Docker Amazon Web Services documentation].


Starting up the instance will take some time. It will:

* create an EC2 instance
* install Docker on the instance
* set up certificates for secure communication with the remote docker engine

If you are getting any error consult the <<troubleshooting>> section.

== Connect Docker to the Remote Engine

Now you need to configure that your docker command line client is using the
newly created remote docker engine on the AWS EC2 instance:

 $ eval $(docker-machine env docker-on-aws)

== Start the DevKit
If you successfully followed the previous step
starting the DevKit does not differ from starting it on your local
machine. For you convenience we created a `docker-compose` file for aws deployments.
In the AWS setup we are not using the microservice configuration located in
this repository. We are using the master branch of the
https://github.com/SMARTRACTECHNOLOGY/smartcosmos-cluster-config[smartcosmos-cluster-config]
repository instead.

To start the SMART COSMOS DevKit on the EC2 instance you will need to run:

 $ docker-compose --file docker-commpose-aws.yml up -d

Note that we specify `docker-compose-aws.yml` as the compose file with the `--file` flag. If you
do not specify a compose file it will
use `docker-compose.yml` instead.

== Other useful Docker Machine Options

Get a **list of all docker-machines**:

 $ docker-machine ls

Get a **help page** with all available commands:

 $ docker-machine help

To **stop** the EC2 instance run:

 $ docker-machine stop devkit-on-aws

You can **start** the stopped EC2 instance again:

 $ docker-machine start devkit-on-aws

To permanently **remove** the EC instance run:

 $ docker-machine rm devkit-on-aws
